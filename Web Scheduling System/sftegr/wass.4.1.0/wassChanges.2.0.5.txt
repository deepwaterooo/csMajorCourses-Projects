Changes from release 2.0.4 to 2.0.5:

1. Added a notification to block page when user sets a schedule opening or deadline.  On 2/15/2010. Kelly.
	Files: block.page.php
2. Added a message for schedule opening in day/week/month views of view calendar.  Schedule opening info will disappear and look like a "regular block" once the deadline is passed.  On 2/15/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: icon_clock.gif, ajax.js, block.js, drawcalendar.js, calendar.css
3. Allow group calendar owner to set netid of block to themselves or a group member.  On 2/16/2010.  Serge and Kelly.
4. Add calendar owner to day/week/month views for group calendars.  On 2/18/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: calendar.css, drawcalendar.js, block.js
5. Added a call to ajax_getCalendars when redrawing the blocks after a block edit.  Group calendar info (putting the user name if this is a group calendar) was not working without knowing whether or not this is a group calendar.  This code adds some more overhead, since this is the only piece of information used out of the calendar (at this point) to redraw blocks correctly.  On 2/19/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: ajax.js, block.js
6. On the block page, for group calendar owner user selection, I updated the code to select the right value in the list for the correct owner.  On 2/19/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: block.page.php
7. Improved code in wassIcal that generates iCal streams (fixed problem with wrapping of lines > 75 characters).  On 2/23/2010. Serge.
	Files: wassIcal.class.php
8. Added more space between the Cancel & Notify button and Close Window button on the Appointment Information page.  On 2/24/2010. Jill.
	Files: apptinfo.page.php	
9. Added 50px in height to the appointment information window.  On 2/24/2010. Kelly.
	Files: global.js
10. Added code to require guests to fill in the Name field when making an appointment.  On 3/1/2010.  Serge.
	Files: createappt.page.php
11. Made the delete block page taller (for IE - not showing "Close Window" message) and fixed alignment of "do not send" prompt.  On 3/2/2010. Kelly.
	Files: calendaractions.js, deleteblock.page.php
12. On the create appointment page, set the cursor to default to the first "netid" field.  on 3/2/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: createappt.page.php
13. On the appointment info page, removed the "Cancel and Notify" button.  On 3/2/2010.  Kelly.
	Files: apptinfo.page.php
14. Changed calendar creation code to generate unqiue calendar titles when creating additional calendars.  On 3/2/2010.  Serge.
	Files: wassCalendar.class.php
15. For people who take multiple timeslots consecutively, only one appointment is stored in the database.  Counts were not showing correctly in month view.  I put in the right calculations to determine how many slots are left based on the # of appointments *and* how long they are.  On 3/9/2010. Kelly.
	Files: drawcalendar.js
16. When user tried to approve manager request, they were getting "invalid credential" error message.  On 4/8/2010.  Serge.
	Files: grantemail.page.php
