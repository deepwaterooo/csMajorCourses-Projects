
Changes from release 3.1.1 to 3.2.0:

1. Added "overlapok" boolean field to wassCalendar to flag that the calendar supports blokcs which overlap blocks in other calendars (but not overlaps with blocks on this calendar).  Serge. 1/30/2011.
	Files:  wass.xsd, maketables.php, wassCalendar.class.php
2. Removed  onclick="this.select();" from the Purpose field on the appointment page.  If users want to select only a subsection of the text to change, the entire text was being selected.  Kelly.  2/11/2011.
	Files: createappt.page.php
3. Moved the login info/Log Out button to the top-middle of the screen, for easier viewing on small screens.  Kelly.  2/11/2011.
	Files: header.js, pageheader.js, styles.css
4. Added a print icon to the Search Appointments page for printing results.  Kelly.  2/11/2011.
	Files: searchappts.page.php
5. Added code to set/unset the "allow overlap" flag on a calendar, and to check the flag when saving a block.  Serge.  2/11/2011.
	Files: calendarsetup.page.php, wassBlock.class.php, wassCalendar.class.php
6. Moved around the search criteria on the appointment search page so that the results appear "higher" on the screen and don't get lost on small screens.  Kelly.  2/27/2011.
	Files: searchappts.page.php
7. Changed const FROMMAIL = 'wass@princeton.edu'; (p used to be a [) and email looked like it was from [rinceton.edu.  Kelly.  2/27/2011.
	Files: wassParms.class.php
8. Added an anchor for the results on the make an appointment page so that users can more easily find the results without having to scroll.  Kelly.  2/27/2011.
	Files: makeappt.page.php
9. Updated license.txt to point to new location of ECL 2.0 license.  Serge.  2/28/2011.
