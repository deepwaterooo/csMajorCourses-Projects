
Changes from release 1 to release 2:

The changes are too extensive to warrant listing every single affected file.  Most of WASS was changed, including all of the classes and many of the pages.

a. People can now create multiple calendars under one netid.

b. People can create "group" calendars, in which individual "members" list their availability.

c. Each calendar can have its own set of managers, and all manager operations are carried out from one page.

d. Notification and reminder settings apply individually to each calendar manager (seperate settings for every manager on every calendar).  

e. People can specify that appointment details should be shown to non-owners/managers.

	Files: calendarsetup.page.php
