Changes from release 3.1.0 to 3.1.1:

1. Fixed messages in wassAjax that did not specify a destination (AJAXERR).  On 12/17/2010. Serge.
	Files: wassAjax.php, wassMsg.class.php
	
2. Moved code to check for required appointment "purpose" from wassAppointment to createappt and wassAjax (because wassAppointment does not know who is creating the app).  On 12/17/2010. Serge.
