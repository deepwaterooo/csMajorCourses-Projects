
Changes from release 2.0.8 to 3.0.0:

1. . Re-structured WASS directory paths to support hosting mof multiple WASS systems.  wassParms.class.php and wassLocal.class.php were moved up to the root directory, and all other code was moved to a "wass" sub-directory.
	Files:  all files that reference wassParms or wassLocal were updated to reflect new location of these files (the autoload script now checks for wassParms or wassLocal and dereferences them appropriately).  The new directory structure is as follows:
	htdocs directory
		local-directory (e.g., princeton) ... optional level;
			.htaccess
			wassParms.class.php
			wassLocal.class.php
			wass directory
				admin directory
				ajax directory
				blackboard directory
				CAS directory
				classes directory
				pages directory
				WASS.DOC
				WASS.pdf
				wass.xsd
	
	Note that htdocs can point directly to the level that includes the wass directory, or to an intervening directory level.
	
	
2. If COURSELIM or USERLIM in wassParms is set to 0, block page does not load properly (slot size list is not set).  Fixed to account for 0 sized course and user lists.  On 8/24/2010. Kelly.
	Files: global.js
