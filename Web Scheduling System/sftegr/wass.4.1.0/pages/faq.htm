<p><span class="faq1_question">I work for three professors. How do I create a calendar for each of them?<br />
</span>You cannot create a calendar for another individual. However, provided an individual has a <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?>, you can become one of their Calendar Managers. Also see information on <a href="#GroupCalendar">Group Calendars</a>. </p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">What is a Calendar Manager?</span><span class="faqQuestion"> <br />
    </span>A Calendar Manager is someone who is granted access to and can maintain and manage a calendar other than their own.  Calendar Managers can do anything a Calendar Owner can do.</p>
<p><span class="faq1_question">Is a Calendar Member the same as a Calendar Manager?</span><span class="faqQuestion"> <br />
</span>There is a slight difference. See <a href="#GroupCalendar">Group Calendars</a> for more information. </p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Can I be a Calendar Manager?</span><br />
    Anyone with a <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> can be a Calendar Manager.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">How do I become a Calendar Manager?</span><span class="faqQuestion"><br />
     </span>Permission must be granted by the Calendar Owner. You can simply ask the Calendar Owner to edit his/her Calendar Setup page&#8212;using the Calendar's Manager(s) panel&#8212;and add your <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> to the list of Calendar Manager(s).  You can also apply to manage someone's calendar, as follows:<br>
     <br />
     <strong>OPTION #1</strong><br />
    If you suspect the individual has never activated his/her own calendar, or if you  want to make it <em>very</em> easy for that person, you can<br />
    1 &#8212; Log into your own calendar.<br />
    2 &#8212; Locate the <span class="faq_button">Apply to Manage</span> button on the lefthand navigation bar. <br />
    3 &#8212; Click it to display the <span class="faq_popup">Apply to Manage/Join a Calendar</span> popup. <br />
    4 &#8212; Enter the <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> of the person whose calendar you wish to manage and click <span class="faq_buttongray">Search</span>.<br>
    5 &#8212; In the Select column, click the checkbox for the calendar in question.<br>
    6 &#8212; Enter supplemental text, if desired, to be included in the e-mail request to the calendar's owner. <br />
    7 &#8212; Click <span class="faq_buttongray">Apply</span> to generate an e-mail  to the Calendar Owner requesting manager status for you. <br />
    <br />
    <span class="style1">OPTION #2</span><br />
    If you already manage at least one other calendar,<br />
    1 &#8212; Log into your own appointment calendar to view the Manage Calendars page.<br />
    2 &#8212; In the bottom right corner of that page, 
        click the <span class="faq_buttongray">Apply</span> button  to display the <span class="faq_popup">Apply to Manage/Join a Calendar </span> popup. <br />
    Continue with steps 4 through 7 from OPTION #1. <br />
    <br />
    <br>
    The resultant e-mail request includes a link that, when clicked by the e-mail's recipient&#8212;the Calendar Owner&#8212;displays an <span class="faq_buttongray">ALLOW</span> button, as shown below. <br>
    <br>
    <img src="images/faq_AllowDeny.gif" border="1"><br>
    <br>
    Once the Calendar Owner approves your request, you'll be granted access and  sent an e-mail to that effect by the system. </p>
<p><span class="faq1_question">How do I get started using my own appointment calendar?</span><span class="faqQuestion"><br />
    </span>Navigate to the <?php echo wassParms::SYSID; ?> home

Once the application has loaded, click the <span class="faq_button">Create Calendar</span> button on the lefthand navigation bar.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">How do I enable my assistant or my TA to edit my appointment calendar?</span><br />
    To allow anyone with a <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> to edit or manage your  appointment calendar, first be sure you've logged into and are displaying the calendar in question.<br />

<p><span class="faq1_question">What is the difference between a calendar and a block?</span><span class="faqQuestion"><br />
                    </span>A calendar is essentially a group of web pages&#8212;divided into days, weeks, and months&#8212;with your name or your organization's name on it. When you add blocks of available time to you calendar, you turn it into an online appointment book. </p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">What is the difference between a block and a slot?</span><br />
    A block is a span of time during which you are available for appointments.  When you create/add a block you must determine if and how it will be sliced up into smaller pieces called slots which then become the available appointment times. You determine the size of the slot, and the system divides the block equally and automatically.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Can I create a block with just one slot? </span><br />
    No. But you can create an 'unslotted' block. An unslotted block is the same thing as a block with a single appointment slot.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Why would I create an unslotted block?</span><br />
    If you don't want to configure a &quot;one appointment per time slot&quot; block, you can instead configure a block to function  simply as a  sign-up sheet. People would, in essence, signify their plans to attend your first-come, first-served appointment, meeting, or other  function or event.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">What's the difference between Calendar Settings and Default Block Settings?</span><br />
    Calendar Settings, in the first section of the Calendar Setup page,  relate to that particular calendar, en total, such as the name of the calendar (as opposed to the name of an individual block) and the calendar's URL.<br>
    <br>
    Default Block Settings are 'pre-emptive' settings, to save you time. They simply populate   the fields for any new blocks  you add to your calendar. But when adding a new block, these fields  will display again, so you are given an opportunity to make  changes, if any, for  the new block.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Are changes to  default block settings retroactive?</span><br />
    If you want them to be. (<em>This question assumes there's at least one block, in the future, already added to the calendar.</em>) <br>
    <br>
    After  launching the Calendar Setup page to make a change to a Default Block Setting, and then clicking the <span class="faq_buttongray">Save</span> button, you will be prompted to choose whether you want your change(s), which will of course apply to any blocks you  create henceforth, to also apply to all of your existing blocks.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Can I change an individual block's settings?</span><br />
    Yes. When you add a block, you are given an opportunity to change its settings. Moreover, you are  able to edit a block's settings anytime after it's been created.</p>
<p>    <span class="faq1_question">Can I control how far in advance someone can schedule an appointment?</span><br />
    Yes. When you create/add a block of time, you will see a field called Scheduling Deadline. Enter the time, in minutes, that represents the minimum notice needed before an appointment can be scheduled.</p>
<p><span class="faq1_question">What are Reminders?</span><br />
    A Reminder is an automated e-mail sent at approximately 5:00 pm on the day prior to a scheduled appointment.  Reminders, by default, are sent to the calendar owner, any calendar managers, and the appointment recipient. </p>
<p><span class="faq1_question">Can a Reminder or Notifications be sent only to the Calendar Manager or only to the Calendar Owner?</span><br />
   Yes. These settings, for the Calendar Owner, are located on the Calendar Setup page&#8212;&quot;Notify Calendar Owner&quot; and &quot;Remind Calendar Owner.&quot; If these are turned on, and only these, then the owner, not the managers will receive the e-mails. If these are turned off and the settings for the calendar managers are turned on&#8212;&quot;Notify Calendar Managers&quot; and &quot;Remind Calendar Managers,&quot; then the managers, not the owner will receive the e-mails. Also see the entry on <a href="#preferences">preferences</a> for more information.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">I see that reminder e-mails are sent one day prior to the appointment. Can this be changed to the weekday prior?</span><br />
   No. Reminders are automatically generated by the system on the day before the scheduled appointment, regardless of the day of the week. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Can  Calendar Managers set preferences<a name="preferences"></a> to determine their notification and reminder e-mail settings? </span><br />
Yes. Whenever a Calendar  Manager is added to a calendar, the panel provides two checkboxes&#8212;one for Notifications and one for Reminders&#8212;both of which are turned on by default. Any Calendar Manager can edit these settings. (Remember, however,  individual Calendar Manager preferences can be overridden by the  block's settings. If a block's settings for Notifications/ Reminders are set to Off, then they will not be sent to the Calendar Manager, even if his/her setting is set to On.)</p>
 <p class="faq_Subheading"><br />
   Working with Appointments<a name="WorkingwithAppointments"></a> </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">How will I know when someone schedules an appointment?</span><br />
  If the setting, Notifications, for the block in which the appointment has been scheduled is turned on (the checkbox is checked) for the Calendar Owner and/or Calendar Managers, the system will automatically and instantly send an e-mail alert. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">How will I know when someone cancels an appointment?</span><br />
  If the setting, Notifications, for the block in which the appointment has been scheduled is turned on (the checkbox is checked) for the Calendar Owner and/or Calendar Manager, the system will automatically and instantly send an e-mail alert.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">How do I retrieve a list of all the appointments I've scheduled on a specific date?</span><br />
Click the <span class="faq_button">Search Appointments</span> button on the lefthand navigation bar. Enter the start and end dates for your search. (Leave the End Date field blank to include all appointments on and after the start date.) Enter any additional filters if needed, and click the <span class="faq_buttongray">Search</span> button. Your list of scheduled appointments will appear at the bottom of the form.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">How do I locate an appointment made by a specific person?</span><br />
  Click the <span class="faq_button">Search Appointments</span> button on the lefthand navigation bar. Enter the start and end dates for your search. (Leave the End Date blank to include all appointments on and after the start date.) Enter the <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> or the full name of the person in question, and click the <span class="faq_buttongray">Search</span> button. The results of your search will appear at the bottom of the form.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Do wild characters, such as * and ?, work with the Search function?</span><br /> 
  No, they will not work with either the Search Appointments or the Make an Appointment function. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">What is the difference between the </span><span class="faq_buttongray">Cancel/Notify</span><span class="faq1_question"> button and the red-X icon?</span><br />
    Using the <span class="faq_buttongray">Cancel/Notify </span>button to cancel an appointment, will, without any further intervention, cancel the appointment. When you use the red-X icon, you will be asked to confirm the deletion and will also be able to add text to the e-mail or suppress the e-mail altogether. <br />
 </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Is  the information above regarding the difference between the </span><span class="faq_buttongray">Cancel/Notify</span><span class="faq1_question"> button and the red-X icon also applicable to the person  who made the appointment?</span><br />
   Yes. The cancellation function and features are the same. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">What is the default e-mail text sent when an appointment is cancelled?</span><br />
   <img src="images/faq_cancelappttxt.gif" width="352" height="329" border="1">   </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">What is the default e-mail text sent when an appointment is scheduled?</span><br />
   <img src="images/faq_makeappttxt.gif" width="352" height="311" border="1"> </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Can I edit the e-mail text sent when an appointment is cancelled?</span><br />
   You cannot delete or replace the default  text of an automated e-mail, however you can add your comments to it. Your text will be added after the first sentence, e.g., &quot;The following appointment has been cancelled: &lt;your text will appear here&gt;&quot;
   and  before the specifics about the appointment. </p>
 <p><span class="faq_Subheading">Group Calendars<a name="GroupCalendars"></a></span></p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">What is a Group Calendar<a name="GroupCalendar"></a>?</span><br />
A Group Calendar is simply a calendar that, unlike the regular calendar, will accept overlapping blocks. Its Calendar Members, like Calendar Managers, can add and edit blocks, but, <strong>just for themselves</strong>. Unlike a Calendar Manager, a Calendar Member cannot edit existing blocks of others. <br>
<br> 
<span class="style2">Warning: </span>Calendar Members can make changes to the entire calendar, to others' e-mail settings, and to all blocks (via Default Block Settings and the Propagate popup) using the Calendar Setup page. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Who can be a Calendar Member?</span><br />
Anyone with a <?php echo wassParms::NETID; ?> can be a Calendar Member.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Is a Calendar Member the same as a Calendar Manager?</span><span class="faqQuestion"> <br />
 </span>There is a slight difference when it comes to adding and editing blocks, but, yes. Like a Calendar Manager, they can edit all  Default Block Settings, add or remove Calendar Members, and even change the name of the calendar. Unlike a Calendar Manager, they are always only adding blocks for themselves, not for the Calendar Owner. </p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Why would I use a Group Calendar?</span><br /> 
   Often, those seeking an appointment are less concerned about with whom they meet, and are more concerned with when they meet. Maybe a student is looking for an appointment for computer assistance from one of ten consultants. A Group Calendar used by those ten consultants that lists all possible appointments would make sense since the appointment seeker just needs to find a convenient date and time, and is willing to meet with anyone available.</p>
 <p><span class="faq1_question">Can Calendar Members set preferences to determine their notification and reminder e-mail settings? </span><br />
  Yes. Whenever a Calendar Member is added to a calendar, the panel provides two checkboxes&#8212;one for Notifications and one for Reminders&#8212;both of which are turned on by default. Any Calendar Member can edit these settings. (Remember, however, individual Calendar Member preferences can be overridden by the block's settings. If a block's settings for Notifications/ Reminders are set to Off, then they will not be sent to the Calendar Member, even if his/her setting is set to On.)</p>

 <p><span class="faq1_question">Why can't I find an appointment calendar for my [boss, colleague, professor, chair]?<span class="faqQuestion"><br />
 </span></span>Not everyone has activated/set up a calendar on the system, and those who do have calendars might have set restrictions on who is allowed to view some or all of its blocks. </p>
