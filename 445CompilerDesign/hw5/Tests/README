runExamples is a UNIX script for runing the tests.

files are file types:

.c-       is the source code
.tm       is the TM code
.in       in the input to the running tm machine (if not
          supplied then runExamples.in will be used)
.out      is the output of the compile and running on tm
.expected is the expected results in out file

good luck
