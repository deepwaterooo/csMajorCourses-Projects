Before the game, the game board is shown as an empty blank array with the bottom row marked with 0 to 6 showing the column number of connect 4, and the first column marked 0 to 5 showing the position of row number. 

There are two players in the game. One player drops X on the board and the other player drops O on the board.

The game board before the game looks like:

1. Output showing the first few moves of a game.

2. Output showing how illegal moves are handled.

3. Output showing a victory.

To make my Project 2 easier later on, the this initial program, I have include the functions to make the user be able to determine if he/she wants to go first. 
From the algorithm point of view, for win check, insteat of counting four-in-a-line for victory only( horizontally, vertically, Left diagonal and right diagonal), I have used the integer argument variable count to indicating the number of pieces in a row that I am counting. That way, using the same function, I can count 4-in-a-row, 3-in-a-row, 2-in-a-row. This is something I thought in advance to assist/faciliate my project 2 evaluation function.
